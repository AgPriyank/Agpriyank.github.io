Hi! Welcome to my website. I started as a PhD student in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department of Columbia University. I work with the fabulous [Shipra Agrawal](http://www.columbia.edu/~sa3305/). I am excited by research questions under the broad umbrella of reinforcement learning and strategic behavior.

In 2021, I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Master in Computer Science, where I was part of [Nan Jiang's](https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/) RL theory group.
