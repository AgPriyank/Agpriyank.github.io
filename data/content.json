      "Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student at Columbia University, where I work with the fabulous <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~sa3305/' target='_blank'>Shipra Agrawal</a>. I am excited by research questions under the broad umbrella of reinforcement learning and algorithm design.",
      "In 2021, I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Master in Computer Science, where I was part of <a href='https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/' target='_blank'>Nan Jiang's</a> RL theory group. In the past, I was a strategist at Goldman Sachs."
