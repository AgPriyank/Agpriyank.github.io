      "Hi! Welcome to my website. I started as a PhD student in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department of Columbia University. I work with the fabulous <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~sa3305/' target='_blank'>Shipra Agrawal</a>. I am excited by research questions under the broad umbrella of reinforcement learning and strategic behavior.",
      "In 2021, I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Master in Computer Science, where I was part of <a href='https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/' target='_blank'>Nan Jiang's</a> RL theory group."
